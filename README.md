# 🚀 Node.js From Scratch — Practice Repo

Welcome to my **Node.js learning playground**!  
This repo contains my journey of practicing **Node.js** starting completely from scratch.  
The code might look a little “street-style” right now 😅 — best practices will come later, promise.  

---

## 📜 What's inside?
- **Pure Node.js** — no frameworks, no magic, just raw JavaScript.
- Hands-on experiments with:
  - HTTP servers
  - File handling
  - Modules & imports
  - Environment variables
  - And more as I go 🚀
- Real-world mini examples while learning

---

## 🛠 Why this repo?
Because learning by doing is the **best way** to understand Node.js.  
You’ll find:
- Beginner-friendly code (even if informal right now)
- Incremental progress
- No unnecessary complexity

---

## 🌟 Support the journey!
If this repo gets **6 stars** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐,  
I’ll upload a **cleaned-up TypeScript version** with:
- Proper folder structure
- Best practices
- Type safety  
… and maybe some extra goodies 😉
