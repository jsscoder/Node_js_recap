Although it's commonly believed that actions speak louder than words, sometimes, nothing can be more soul-stirring and inspirational than a powerful string of words said at the right time. Every time anime characters make their voices truly heard, be it in a motivational speech of encouragement or a heart-wrenching final monologue, their sincere sentiment has an impact both on the audience and those they're addressing. Even those speeches more humorous than serious, like Sakata Gintoki's, are worth remembering.
